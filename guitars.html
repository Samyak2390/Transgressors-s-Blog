				<h2>1. .Strandberg* Boden OS7</h2>

					<p class="p1">
						The body shape is perfect for me. It’s convenient to play in any position 
						you can imagine. The output jack is situated in a very convenient place and
						I don’t even notice the cable presence when it’s plugged in.
					
						The body is extremely light-weight, I think, it’s even lighter than my Ibanez S-series guitar.<br><br>

						The knobs are made of ebony which saves some weight (if you compare to metal ones) 
						as well and feels pretty good.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						Neck is very comfortable to play, it has fanned frets though which can cause 
						troubles when you bend too far but usually I don’t even notice them.<br><br>
						Locking nut is very easy to use, no problem here. Also, the neck has side dots 
						which are illuminated in a dark environment, can be useful for a stage performance, I assume.
						
						Also, a good part is the truss rod, it’s very well-accessible, I mean you don’t have to <br><br>
						do anything to access it in comparison to most guitars where you have to lose a couple of
						strings and/or remove a plastic shield, +1 to the headless design.

				<h2>2. Gibson Les Paul</h2>
				<div>

					<p class="p1">
						The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson
						Guitar Corporation in 1952.[3] The Les Paul was designed by Gibson president Ted McCarty,
						factory manager John Huis and their team, along with guitarist/inventor Les Paul. Its design
						typically comprises a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, 
						a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and
						tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. 
						In 1957, humbucking pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. 
						The sunburst 1958–1960 Les Paul – today one of the best-known electric guitar 
						types in the world – was considered a failure, with low production and sales. 
						For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what is now known as the Gibson SG. 
						This design continued as a separate guitar when the traditional single cutaway, 
						carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. The Les Paul has been continually 
						produced in countless versions and editions since. Along with Fender's Telecaster 
						and Stratocaster, it was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars. 
						Due to their versatility, Les Paul electric guitars have been used in a wide range of 
						music genres, including rock, country, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy metal.
